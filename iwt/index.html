  <p>Hey Ramit,</p>
  <p>Everyone wants to live a rich life, but not everyone knows how. I definitely didn't, until I picked up your book one day in 2010. Since then, I've purchased five IWT products that have helped me tremendously in my personal and professional life. Now I want in. I would be an outstanding addition to your team as a UI/UX designer, and here's why:</p>
  <br>
  <h1>Why Me?</h1>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>I'm a customer, and I get what you're doing.</strong> For the past year and a half, I've worked on a product (MortgageHippo) aimed at educating potential homebuyers on the process and true cost of getting a mortgage. Nobody wants to hear the cold hard truths about buying a house, just like most people would rather send off hundreds of resumes in hopes that one will land them the job they've been dreaming of. It's hard, but I've found that designing a great customer experience is game changing when it comes to inducing real behavior change.</p> 
  <p><strong>I know how pivotal great UI/UX is to how you present your course material to students.</strong> I also know it's not all about pixels. You could have easily posted an audio link of your RBT interviews, but instead you put together a professionally produced video complete with cuts and graphics. To me that's great UX, and I love that shit. Whether it's studying mathematical shade gradients or getting a site to compile faster, I'm all about going above and beyond and I would be looking to do the same at IWT. 
  <br>
  I also know how important it is to study your audience: at MortgageHippo, one of my most enjoyable duties is performing usability testing, including reaching out directly to customers for qualitative insight.</p> 
  <br>
  <p><strong>I don't want to just be a UI/UX designer.</strong> I guess that's kinda weird to say on a cover letter, but I really don't. Whether design or development, I like to get my hands dirty with all aspects of product development. After becoming very proficient in HTML/CSS/JS, I taught myself Ruby so I could do more within a Rails app. Our Wordpress blog sucked for the longest time, so I pulled up my sleeves and got familiar with PHP. I even managed to get MortgageHippo 20,000+ views in a month as a result of rogue marketing efforts. I'd look to do the same thing at IWT, excelling especially in UI/UX while mixing it up and contributing to the rest of your team. By the way, as a former D1 NCAA track athlete, I'd love to develop a performance running module for IWT Fit.</p> 
  <br>
  <p><strong>Now for the technical stuff.</strong> I have five years experience designing and developing web and mobile interfaces. Photoshop and Sketch are my go-to design programs, and I generally start with Sketch if the project is vector-based. I use Balsamiq for wireframing and occasionally dip into Invision if it's a mobile project. I'm highly proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, preferring to write in Haml, SCSS/SASS, and CoffeeScript for compiling and always making sure the site is responsive for tablet and mobile. On the programming side, I am most comfortable with Ruby but also have experience writing in PHP (mainly through Wordpress) and know my way around Git. Finally, Optimizely is my go-to third party A/B testing tool. Phew!</p>
