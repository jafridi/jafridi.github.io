I was recently featured in the [Chicago Tribune's Blue Sky Innovation][chicagotribune] where I discussed balancing work as a product developer at MortgageHippo with fasting during Ramadan. I'm happy to have contributed to such a great piece, even if it meant including an awkward photo of me eating a chip.
